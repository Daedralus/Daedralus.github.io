                <h2>Tournament Rules</h2>

                <h3>Version Restrictions</h3>

                <p>
                    This tournament will be played with the Wars of Liberty mod, so all players must have the latest version of Wars of Liberty installed. The current version is 1.0.11b, released May 18th, 2019. If you downloaded the mod before this date, please run your updater to ensure that you have the correct version.
                    If you do not have the mod, you can download it here. Simply download and run the installer, following the onscreen instructions, or watch this YouTube video for help.
                </p>

                <h3>Civilization Restrictions</h3>
                <p>
                    In a Best-of-3, you must win with 2 different civilizations.<br />
                    In a Best-of-5, you must win with 3 different civilizations.<br />
                    In a Best-of-7, you must win with 4 different civilizations.<br /><br />

                    For the 1st game in a series, players will agree on a civilization matchup. After that, the winner of the previous game will select their civilization first. This pick is final and will be locked in. Their opponent will then pick their civilization afterwards.

                    Once you have won with a civilization, you may not use it again for the rest of the series. Losing a game does not disable a player’s civilization from being played again. In addition, once a player has won with a civilization from the base AoE3 game, none of the other base civilizations may be played. For example, winning with China then precludes a player from playing with Britain, Iroquois, Ottoman, etc.

                    Example (Best-of-3)
                    Note: The tournament staff may ban a civilization from play if deemed necessary. Previous games using that civilization will not be penalized.
                </p><br />
                <h3>Gameplay Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    1.1 - All games must be played on the Wars of Liberty mod.
                    <br />
                    1.2 - Every game must be recorded.
                    <br />
                    1.3 - Winners must submit recorded games using the Match Results Submitter found here.
                    <br />
                    1.4 - Every player must respect their opponent, casters and organizers. Misbehavior** will result in a warning and can lead to disqualification. Racism and/or insults will not be tolerated. More information regarding this can be found in the Disqualification Rules section.
                    <br />
                    1.5 - When a player disconnects from the internet BEFORE 2 minutes, the player can (when both agree) restart and replay the game. When the opponent does not agree to restart, the outcome of the game will be determined by the tournament staff.
                    <br />
                    1.6 - When a player disconnects AFTER 2 minutes, the players can (when both agree) restart and replay the game. When the opponent does not agree to restart, the player who lost connection will be given a loss.
                    <br />
                    1.7 - Every player may restart a game BEFORE the 2 minute mark when necessary. This is allowed ONCE per map when the game is NOT casted by an official caster. Restarts for CASTED games will be determined by the caster him/herself.
                    <br />
                    1.8 - The caster is allowed to restart a game as many times as necessary for optimal play.
                    <br />
                    1.10 - Recorded games must be submitted with match results. Failure to do so may result in a match being considered invalid.
                    <br />
                    1.11 - Players must be respectful to each other when selecting civilizations during the first game in a series. Players cannot intentionally change to unfair match-ups, or otherwise be difficult to agree with. The tournament staff reserves the right to two possible outcomes. 1) If only one player is deemed challenging, then that player will be forced to pick their civilization first. 2) If both players are disagreeable, then a blind pick will be enforced.

                    <li>All 40 civs were played at least once during the tournament</li>
                    <li>Kaister saved Argentina from a 0% win rate!</li>
                    <li>If zoomnig had not played Mexico, and zatoriyakiyo had not played Romania, we definitely would not have seen all 40 civs</li>
                    <li>Bulgaria would have had a 100% win rate if people had not trolled the less experienced people into picking them. Example: rickybawse: "WHY CAN'T I TRAIN UNITS!?"</li>
                    <li>Peru was picked against Malta 3 times total. 2 of which were done intentionally to "throw" a weak civ</li>
                    <li>Belgium had a 0% win rate with 5-6 games before Comet saved it. It was played a few more times for 4 wins total, most of it being Comet.</li>
                    <li>Zulu essentially has a 100% win rate given it's only loss was in a game with about a 20PR difference</li>
                    <li>Top 5 most played civilizations were, in order; Greece, Malta, Brazil, Korea, Ottomans </li>
                    <li>Paraguay was very popular and successful in the earlier rounds, but was never played after Ro16</li>
                    <li>Mitoe lost with multiple 100% win-rate civs, being the first loss of Serbia and the only loss with Habsburgs</li>
                    <li>mirmydons saved Spain from a 0% win rate!</li>
                    <li>The main reason Watering Hole was removed from the map pool was because zoomnig rushed the observers base rather than his opponent</li>
                    <li>The most unique strategy was done by _io where he performed a fast revolt with Malta to get an army of Imperial Hoop Throwers vs poor Peru. Video on YouTube</li>
                    <li>Although most videos are on YouTube/Twitch Higlights, the missing ones are due to being played off stream or being streamed on ESOC-TV</li>
                    <li></li>
